Description: highlight differences between two builds of Debian packages
 debbindiff was designed to easily compare two builds of the same Debian
 package, and understand their differences.
 .
 It can be scripted through error codes, and an HTML report can be produced
 with the detected differences.
 .
 debbindiff was written as part of the “reproducible builds” Debian
 project.
